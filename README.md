First Hackathon project for Wild Code School.

Objective: create a web application using public API call in a short delay time (30 hours)

We decided to create an AIR BNB like app for people who wants to rent their appartments.
We created our own database (for the first time), API using Node.js and Express and React JS for the frontend side.

The team was composed of Mohamed, Alexandre and me.

Sadly we did not get the time to fully integrate the possibility of images uploading when an appartment is added but wr are pretty happy with the result.
